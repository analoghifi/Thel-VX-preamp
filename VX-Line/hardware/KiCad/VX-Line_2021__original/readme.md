this is not the original Thel PCB but it's very like\* the original with the following exceptions:  
* more massive ground and power supply PCB tracks  
* using a combined 2.5mm/5.0mm pin spacing footprint for the small ceramic caps (C1,C2,C3,C11)  
  
\*(same schematic / same board dimensions / same 1-layer\** layout THT / same THT components in the same places on the board)  
\**(strictly speaking, this KiCad PCB is a two-layer PCB with plated-through holes, but you can also (let) produce it as a classic 1-layer PCB with non-plated holes if you wish, since all the tracks are on the bottom side only)

### remarks:  
#### U1:  
instead of [LME49720](https://www2.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/LME49720NA-NOPB?qs=7lkVKPoqpbYtIqwyg5iDaA%3D%3D) you can use [LM4562](https://www2.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/LM4562NA-NOPB?qs=QbsRYf82W3Gc2w4DLq%252BZjw%3D%3D) (both Texas Instruments),  
these two are 100% identical (even regarding their inner guts).
