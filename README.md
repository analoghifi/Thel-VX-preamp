### "VX-D" (2007 - 2016):  
* fully discrete circuit (all transistors / no OP-Amps)
* single ended input
* single ended output
* AC coupled input (with film/foil input cap)
* MOSFET Class-A output
* very low-impedance output / is able to drive 1W @ 8Ω (8Ω short-term / 22Ω permanently)
* adjustable gain (16 steps)
* can also be used very well as a "high-end" headphone amplifier
* operating voltage min./max.: ±9V .. ±63V (optimum: ±24V .. ±36V)
