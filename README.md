### "VX-D" (2007 - 2016):  
* fully discrete circuit (all transistors / no OP-Amps)
* single ended input
* single ended output
* AC coupled input (with film/foil input cap)
* MOSFET Class-A output
* very low-impedance output / is able to drive 1W @ 8Ω (8Ω short-term / 22Ω permanently)
* adjustable gain (16 steps)
* usable as a "high-end" headphone amp as well
* operating voltage min./max.: +/-9V .. +/-63V (optimum: +/-24V .. +/-36V)
